Battlebase — small original battle-royale inspired demo

How to run:

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or run `open index.html` on macOS).

Controls:

- Move: `W A S D` or arrow keys
- Aim: move mouse
- Shoot: hold left mouse button (consumes ammo)
- Press `Start Match` to spawn bots and start the storm
 - Switch weapons: press `1` for Rifle, `2` for Shotgun
 - Sound: toggle with the `Sound` button in the HUD (audio initializes on first start)
 - Difficulty: choose from the HUD selector before starting the match. Higher difficulty increases bot count, HP, speed, and accuracy.
 - Weapons: press `1` = Rifle, `2` = Shotgun, `3` = SMG, `4` = Sniper, `5` = Rocket. Each weapon has different fire rate and damage. Rockets explode on impact.

Notes:

- This is an original demo inspired by battle-royale mechanics. It intentionally avoids any copyrighted characters or trademarks.
- Next steps: add sounds, building mechanics, better AI, multiplayer.
